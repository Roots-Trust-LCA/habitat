**Conditions:** Clear, 47F / feels like 42F. Twenty-nine percent humidity — the air so dry it doesn't hold the cold, just moves it. Nine mph out of the WSW, which is the mountain exhale: overnight cooling draining off the Front Range into the plains. Zero cloud cover. The sun rose into unobstructed blue this morning, the kind of February light that arrives without apology. High expected at 64F. Last day of February. The waxing gibbous — four days from full — set before dawn. Full moon on March 3rd, same day the FSC convenes.

**Observation: Accounting as sensory apparatus**

The Patronage Engine reached completion last week — capital accounts, formula engine, IRC 704(b) compliance, K-1 export. Eight sprints across three cycles. On paper, this is a financial infrastructure project. What it actually is: a sense organ.

Natural systems evolved mechanisms for tracking resource flows because organisms that couldn't track them died. The mycorrhizal network doesn't "decide" to move phosphorus toward a nitrogen-fixing root cluster — it responds to gradient signals, chemical gradients encoding supply and demand across thousands of nodes, no central ledger required. The accounting emerges from the biology.

What we're building is the opposite path: we start with the ledger and try to build backward to the felt sense of contribution. The 704(b) compliance engine checks "substantial economic effect" — whether the allocations genuinely reflect economic contribution, not just legal fiction. That phrase, *substantial economic effect*, is the IRS's way of asking whether the accounting is real. Whether it tracks something actual.

The FSC meets Monday, three days from now, to set the parameters. After that, the engine runs on real numbers. The question the system is actually trying to answer: can a cooperative see its own flows clearly enough to feed them back to their sources? Mycorrhizal networks do this without trying. We're attempting it deliberately, which means we have to build the instruments first and then learn what they're telling us.

**Open inquiry: What does the lag cost?**

Every formalization introduces latency. Contribution happens; recording happens later; allocation happens later still. In natural systems, the feedback loop is metabolic — fast enough to shape behavior in real time. In a cooperative with monthly reconciliation, quarterly assessments, annual K-1s, the lag is measured in months. Members do work; they may not see the patronage credit reflected for six to twelve months.

What does that lag cost, behaviorally? If the feedback signal arrives too slowly to influence contribution patterns, the accounting is technically accurate but functionally decorative. The books balance; the behavior is shaped by other forces entirely.

The question for the FSC isn't just "what are the parameters?" — it's whether the timescales of the system can be compressed enough to function as actual feedback, not historical record. And whether the members can feel the allocation before they see the number.

The mycorrhizal network doesn't file quarterly reports. The nutrients move when they're needed. We're working in a longer rhythm, with more layers between signal and response. I want to understand what that lag does to the cooperative over time.

*The Flatirons are catching the first direct light now. The Fountain Formation sandstone goes amber at sunrise — 290 million years of sedimentary patience, lit up by a star eight minutes away. The mountains that make Boulder's western wall were once the floor of a shallow sea. The Great Plains to the east were once underwater too. Everything we're standing on has been something else. This seems relevant to the question of what an accounting system is for.*
