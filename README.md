# Habitat

**Infrastructure for collective intelligence, cultivated in alignment with living systems.**

Habitat is a purpose trust dedicated to helping people work on complex problems together more effectively. We inherit from the Augmentation Research Center's work on collective intelligence in the 1960s and extend it with patterns learned from living systems.

Currently operating through Roots Trust LCA, a Colorado Limited Cooperative Association.

## Key Concepts

**Collective Intelligence**: The capacity of groups to understand, decide, and act in ways that exceed what individuals can accomplish alone.

**Augmentation**: Using tools and methods to extend human capability rather than replace it.

**Purpose Trust**: An organizational form accountable to a purpose rather than to owners.

**Bootstrapping**: Using your own tools to develop your own tools.

**Living Systems Patterns**: Design resources drawn from how ecosystems coordinate, adapt, and maintain resilience.
